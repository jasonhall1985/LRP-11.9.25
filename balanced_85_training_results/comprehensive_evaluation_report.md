## Baseline Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Dataset Size | Balance | Architecture | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Doctor-Focused Model (75.9%) | 75.90% | 260 | Imbalanced (doctor-biased) | CNN-LSTM | Strong doctor bias, good same-demographic performance |
| Balanced 61-Per-Class (37.5%) | 37.50% | 244 | Perfectly balanced (61 per class) | CNN-LSTM | Eliminated bias but lower accuracy |
| Balanced 85-Per-Class (51.47%) | 51.47% | 340 | Perfectly balanced (85 per class) | Lightweight CNN-LSTM (2.2M params) | Best balanced performance, larger dataset |
| Ultra-Light 85-Per-Class (35.29%) | 35.29% | 340 | Perfectly balanced (85 per class) | Ultra-Light CNN-LSTM (0.6M params) | Heavily regularized, prevented overfitting |

## Analysis & Conclusions

### Dataset Size Limitations
- **Current dataset**: 340 videos (272 train + 68 validation)
- **Per-class training data**: 68 videos per class
- **Validation data**: 17 videos per class
- **Assessment**: Dataset size appears insufficient for 82% accuracy target

### Model Architecture Insights
- **Lightweight models** (2.2M params) performed better than heavy models (15M+ params)
- **Overfitting** was a consistent challenge across all architectures
- **Regularization** helped but couldn't overcome fundamental data limitations

### Recommendations
1. **Dataset Expansion**: Target 200-300 videos per class (800-1200 total)
2. **Data Quality**: Focus on consistent preprocessing and high-quality recordings
3. **Transfer Learning**: Consider pre-trained models or domain adaptation
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for improved performance
5. **Alternative Approaches**: Explore transformer-based architectures or self-supervised learning

### Success Criteria Assessment
- ❌ **≥82% validation accuracy**: Not achieved (best: 51.47%)
- ✅ **Perfect class balance**: Achieved (85 videos per class)
- ✅ **Cross-demographic validation**: Implemented with 14 demographic groups
- ✅ **Overfitting prevention**: Addressed through regularization and early stopping
- ✅ **Efficient training**: Models trained successfully on CPU

## Conclusion

While the 85-per-class balanced dataset represents a significant improvement in data quality and balance, the 82% validation accuracy target was not achieved. The best performing model (Lightweight CNN-LSTM) reached 51.47% accuracy, indicating that dataset expansion is necessary to achieve the target performance. The perfect class balance and cross-demographic validation framework provide a solid foundation for future improvements with larger datasets.
