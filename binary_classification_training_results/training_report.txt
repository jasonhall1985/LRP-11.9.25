BINARY CROSS-DEMOGRAPHIC TRAINING REPORT
================================================================================

CONFIGURATION:
----------------------------------------
Classes: help vs doctor (2 classes)
Training demographic: 65+ female Caucasian
Validation demographic: 18-39 male not_specified
Training videos: 48
Validation videos: 8
Batch size: 8
Max epochs: 30
Training time: 171.7s

FINAL RESULTS:
----------------------------------------
Final training accuracy: 54.17%
Final validation accuracy: 50.00%
Best validation accuracy: 62.50%
Total epochs: 21

SUCCESS CRITERIA EVALUATION:
----------------------------------------
Training accuracy ≥ 90.0%: ❌ FAIL (54.17%)
Cross-demographic validation ≥ 70.0%: ❌ FAIL (50.00%)
Overall success: ❌ FAIL

NEXT STEPS:
----------------------------------------
❌ Pipeline validation failed - debug issues before 7-class training
   - Training accuracy insufficient - check model architecture/learning rate
   - Cross-demographic generalization poor - consider data augmentation
