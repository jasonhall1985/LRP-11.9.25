# 🎯 ROADMAP TO 80% LIP-READING ACCURACY

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS & STRATEGY**

**Current Situation:** Multiple approaches achieving only 20% accuracy  
**Root Cause:** Systematic pipeline issues (not architectural)  
**Strategy:** Fix pipeline → Optimize incrementally → Apply advanced techniques  
**Target Timeline:** 2-3 hours to 80% accuracy

## 🛠️ **PHASE 3: SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING (IN PROGRESS)**

### **Goal:** Restore 40% Baseline
**Status:** 🔄 Running `phase3_systematic_debugging.py`  
**Approach:** Recreate EXACT original conditions that achieved 40%

**Key Debugging Points:**
- ✅ Same random seeds (42)
- ✅ Same data splits (8 train, 1 val, 1 test per class)
- ✅ Same preprocessing (BGR→Gray, 112x112, simple normalization)
- ✅ Same model architecture (3D CNN, 290K params target)
- ✅ Same training (Adam lr=1e-3, batch_size=1, early stopping)

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Success (≥35%):** Pipeline fixed, ready for optimization
- **Partial (25-35%):** Minor issues, need small adjustments  
- **Failure (<25%):** Major debugging still needed
