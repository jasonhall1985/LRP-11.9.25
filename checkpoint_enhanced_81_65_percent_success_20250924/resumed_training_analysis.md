# üîç **RESUMED TRAINING ANALYSIS - 75.9% Checkpoint**

**Analysis Date:** 2025-09-23 07:30:00  
**Training Duration:** Epochs 22-41 (20 epochs)  
**Starting Point:** 72.41% validation accuracy (epoch 21)  
**Target:** 82% cross-demographic validation accuracy  

## üìä **CRITICAL FINDINGS**

### **üö® SEVERE OVERFITTING DETECTED**
- **Training Accuracy:** 78.12% ‚Üí 97.77% (+19.65%)
- **Validation Accuracy:** 72.41% ‚Üí 58.62% (-13.79%)
- **Gap:** Training-Validation gap increased from ~6% to ~39%

### **‚ùå TARGET NOT ACHIEVED**
- **Target:** 82% validation accuracy
- **Best Achieved:** 72.41% (starting checkpoint)
- **Final:** 58.62% validation accuracy
- **Gap:** -23.38 percentage points below target

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **1. Overfitting Indicators**
- Training accuracy reached 97%+ while validation dropped
- Validation loss increased from ~1.0 to ~1.5
- Per-class validation performance became erratic
- Model memorized training data instead of generalizing

### **2. Balanced Sampling Issues**
- WeightedRandomSampler may have caused over-sampling of minority classes
- Class distribution imbalance still present:
  - my_mouth_is_dry: 81 videos (35.1%) - majority class
  - pillow: 44 videos (19.0%) - minority class
  - 1.84x imbalance ratio despite weighting

### **3. Learning Rate Problems**
- Initial LR: 0.0005 may have been too high for fine-tuning
- CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts caused LR oscillations (0.0005 ‚Üí 0.005)
- Model couldn't stabilize on validation data

### **4. Dataset Size Limitations**
- Training: 231 videos (very small for deep learning)
- Validation: 29 videos (extremely small for reliable evaluation)
- Cross-demographic split may be too challenging

## üìà **EPOCH-BY-EPOCH BREAKDOWN**

| Epoch | Train Acc | Val Acc | Val Loss | Status |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| 21 (start) | ~72% | 72.41% | ~1.0 | Baseline |
| 22 | 78.12% | 17.24% | 2.02 | Immediate drop |
| 26 | 90.18% | 62.07% | 1.10 | Recovering |
| 31 | 94.64% | 65.52% | 1.21 | Peak validation |
| 36 | 97.32% | 58.62% | 1.26 | Overfitting |
| 41 | 94.64% | 58.62% | 1.34 | Early stop |

## üéØ **PER-CLASS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**

### **Training Performance (Final)**
- my_mouth_is_dry: 96.4% ‚úÖ
- i_need_to_move: 98.3% ‚úÖ
- doctor: 90.7% ‚úÖ
- pillow: 92.9% ‚úÖ

### **Validation Performance (Final)**
- my_mouth_is_dry: 100.0% ‚úÖ (4/4 samples)
- i_need_to_move: 75.0% ‚ö†Ô∏è (6/8 samples)
- doctor: 40.0% ‚ùå (4/10 samples)
- pillow: 42.9% ‚ùå (3/7 samples)

### **Class-Specific Issues**
- **my_mouth_is_dry:** Perfect validation but only 4 samples
- **doctor:** Severe degradation from baseline
- **pillow:** Poor performance despite balanced weighting
- **i_need_to_move:** Moderate performance

## üîß **TECHNICAL CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS**

### **What Worked**
- Model architecture: 2.98M parameters loaded successfully
- Checkpoint loading: State preserved correctly
- WeightedRandomSampler: Implemented correctly
- Early stopping: Prevented further overfitting

### **What Failed**
- **Learning Rate Schedule:** Too aggressive for fine-tuning
- **Class Weighting:** Didn't prevent overfitting
- **Regularization:** Insufficient for small dataset
- **Data Augmentation:** May have been too aggressive

## üí° **STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Reduce Learning Rate:** 0.0005 ‚Üí 0.0001 or lower
2. **Increase Regularization:** Higher dropout, weight decay
3. **Simplify LR Schedule:** Use ReduceLROnPlateau instead
4. **Reduce Batch Size:** 8 ‚Üí 4 for better generalization

### **Dataset Improvements**
1. **Expand Validation Set:** 29 samples too small for reliable evaluation
2. **Balance Classes Properly:** True equal sampling, not weighted
3. **Cross-Validation:** K-fold to get better performance estimates
4. **Data Quality:** Review validation samples for quality issues

### **Architecture Modifications**
1. **Freeze Early Layers:** Only fine-tune final layers
2. **Add Batch Normalization:** Better regularization
3. **Reduce Model Capacity:** Smaller model for small dataset
4. **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple models

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS FOR 82% TARGET**

### **Option 1: Conservative Fine-Tuning**
- LR: 0.00001 (100x reduction)
- Freeze conv layers, only train FC layers
- Minimal augmentation
- Focus on preventing overfitting

### **Option 2: Dataset Expansion**
- Use enhanced balanced dataset (536 videos)
- Better train/val split (80/20 instead of cross-demographic)
- More validation samples for reliable evaluation

### **Option 3: Architecture Redesign**
- Lightweight model (1-2M parameters)
- Designed for small datasets
- Strong regularization built-in

## üìã **CONCLUSION**

The resumed training from the 75.9% checkpoint **failed to achieve the 82% target** due to severe overfitting. The model memorized the training data but lost generalization capability. The cross-demographic validation split with only 29 samples proved too challenging for the current approach.

**Key Insight:** The 75.9% checkpoint represents a local optimum that's difficult to improve upon with the current dataset size and cross-demographic evaluation setup. Success requires either:
1. Fundamental changes to training approach (conservative fine-tuning)
2. Dataset expansion for more robust evaluation
3. Architecture redesign for small dataset scenarios

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Option 2 (dataset expansion) using the enhanced 536-video balanced dataset for more reliable training and evaluation.
