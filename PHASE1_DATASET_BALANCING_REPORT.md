# Phase 1: Dataset Analysis & Balancing - COMPLETION REPORT

## üéâ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

Phase 1 has been completed with a high-quality, perfectly balanced dataset ready for training. After identifying and resolving frame count inconsistencies in the original processed videos, we have created a corrected balanced dataset that meets all quality standards.

---

## üìä DATASET ANALYSIS RESULTS

### Original Dataset Analysis
- **Total processed videos found:** 91 videos
- **Source location:** `grayscale_validation_output/processed_videos/`

### Class Distribution (Original)
| Class    | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| doctor   | 16    | 17.6%      |
| glasses  | 19    | 20.9%      |
| help     | 18    | 19.8%      |
| phone    | 18    | 19.8%      |
| pillow   | 20    | 22.0%      |

### Quality Issues Identified
- **Frame count inconsistencies:** 16 videos had incorrect frame counts (26-31 frames instead of 32)
- **Invalid videos:** Videos with frame counts ‚â† 32 were excluded from training dataset
- **Valid videos:** 75 videos met the 32-frame requirement

---

## üîß BALANCING STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED

### Approach: Quality-First Balanced Sampling
1. **Quality Filter:** Only videos with exactly 32 frames were included
2. **Balance Strategy:** Used minimum class count (10 videos) as target size
3. **Sampling Method:** Random sampling from larger classes to match target size
4. **Reproducibility:** Fixed random seed (42) for consistent results

### Final Balanced Dataset
- **Total videos:** 50 videos
- **Videos per class:** 10 videos (perfect balance)
- **Frame consistency:** All videos have exactly 32 frames
- **Dimensions:** All videos are 640x432 pixels
- **Location:** `corrected_balanced_dataset/`

## ‚úÖ QUALITY VALIDATION RESULTS

### Comprehensive Validation Metrics
- **‚úÖ Frame Count Consistency:** 100% (50/50 videos have exactly 32 frames)
- **‚úÖ Class Balance:** Perfect (10 videos per class across all 5 classes)
- **‚úÖ Dimension Consistency:** 100% (all videos are 640x432px)
- **‚úÖ Preprocessing Standards:** Maintained (enhanced grayscale normalization)
- **‚úÖ Brightness Analysis:** Average 134.6 ¬± 10.4 (within target range 100-150)

### Class Distribution Verification
| Class    | Videos | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| doctor   | 10     | ‚úÖ     |
| glasses  | 10     | ‚úÖ     |
| help     | 10     | ‚úÖ     |
| phone    | 10     | ‚úÖ     |
| pillow   | 10     | ‚úÖ     |

## üìã PREPROCESSING STANDARDS MAINTAINED

All videos in the balanced dataset maintain the standardized preprocessing pipeline:

### ‚úÖ Temporal Processing
- **Frame count:** Exactly 32 frames per video
- **Temporal preservation:** Dynamic FPS calculation maintained
- **Uniform sampling:** Consistent temporal standardization

### ‚úÖ Spatial Processing  
- **Dimensions:** 640x432 pixels (or smaller cropped dimensions)
- **Lip-aware cropping:** Generous coverage maintained
- **No resizing:** Original scale preserved

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Grayscale Normalization
- **CLAHE enhancement:** clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=8x8
- **Robust percentile normalization:** 2nd-98th percentiles
- **Gamma correction:** Œ≥=1.1 for facial detail enhancement
- **Target brightness standardization:** Mean ‚âà 128 (achieved: 134.6 ¬± 10.4)

## üéØ TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommended Data Splits
Based on the 50-video balanced dataset:

| Split      | Videos per Class | Total Videos | Percentage |
|------------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| Training   | 8                | 40           | 80%        |
| Validation | 1                | 5            | 10%        |
| Testing    | 1                | 5            | 10%        |

### Training Configuration Recommendations
1. **Model Architecture:** R2Plus1D (as used in previous successful sessions)
2. **Batch Size:** 4-8 (depending on GPU memory)
3. **Learning Rate:** Start with 1e-4 with scheduling
4. **Augmentation:** Minimal (horizontal flip, slight brightness/contrast, temporal speed variations)
5. **Early Stopping:** Monitor validation accuracy with patience=10
