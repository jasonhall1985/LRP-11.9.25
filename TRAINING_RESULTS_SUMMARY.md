- **Global Label Map**: Consistent indexing across all splits
- **ROI Stabilization**: 100% geometric cropping success

## üìä Performance Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Honest Cross-Speaker Generalization**: 51.2% without contamination
2. **Consistent Training**: All folds completed successfully
3. **Progressive Learning**: Clear improvement patterns across epochs
4. **Robust Architecture**: Lightweight yet effective design

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Speaker 6 Performance**: Lowest accuracy (45.2%) - may need more data
2. **Variance**: 6.5% standard deviation indicates room for consistency improvement
3. **Gap to Target**: Need ~31 percentage points to reach 82% goal

## üéØ Progress Toward Goals

### ‚úÖ Immediate Targets Achieved
