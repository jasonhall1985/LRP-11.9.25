  Retention rate: 1.6%
  Pros: Highest quality videos with clear lip movement
  Cons: Very small dataset, may lack diversity

BALANCED FILTERING:
  Description: Keep Tier 1-3 (Good+ lip motion)
  Criteria: lip_motion_rate >= 0.15
  Videos retained: 89
  Retention rate: 4.3%
  Pros: Good balance of quality and quantity
  Cons: Still relatively small dataset

INCLUSIVE FILTERING:
  Description: Keep Tier 1-4 (Moderate+ lip motion)
  Criteria: lip_motion_rate >= 0.05
  Videos retained: 192
  Retention rate: 9.4%
  Pros: Larger dataset for training
  Cons: Includes videos with minimal lip movement

FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
==================================================
Based on the comprehensive analysis:

• RECOMMENDED: Conservative filtering (Tier 1 only)
  - Sufficient high-quality videos available
  - Focus on videos with excellent lip movement

• Lip motion is more predictive than overall motion for lip-reading
• Focus filtering criteria on lip_motion_rate >= 0.15
• Consider manual review of borderline cases
• Correlation between overall and lip motion: 0.713
