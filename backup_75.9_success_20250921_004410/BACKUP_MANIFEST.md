**Backup Created:** 2025-09-21 00:44:10  
**Performance Achieved:** 75.9% cross-demographic validation accuracy  
**Training Type:** Doctor-focused 4-class improvement training  
**Architecture:** 2.98M parameter CNN-3D model  

## üìÅ **BACKUP CONTENTS**

### **Core Model & Results**
- `doctor_focused_results/best_doctor_focused_model.pth` - **CRITICAL**: Trained model achieving 75.9% validation accuracy
- `doctor_focused_results/doctor_focused_report.txt` - Complete training results and metrics
- `doctor_focused_results/doctor_focused_curves.png` - Training curves visualization
- `doctor_focused_results/doctor_confusion_matrix.png` - Confusion matrix analysis

### **Training Scripts & Configuration**
- `doctor_focused_trainer.py` - **CRITICAL**: Complete training pipeline with proven hyperparameters
- `fourclass_cross_demographic_trainer.py` - Original 4-class baseline trainer (72.4% accuracy)
- `doctor_class_analyzer.py` - Analysis script that identified doctor class bottleneck
- `comprehensive_demographic_splitter.py` - Dataset splitting with demographic separation

### **Dataset Splits & Analysis**
- `classifier training 20.9.25/` - **CRITICAL**: Complete dataset splits used for training
  - Cross-demographic splits with 65+ female Caucasian (training) ‚Üí 18-39 male (validation)
  - 231 training videos, 29 validation videos for 4-class scenario
  - Balanced class distribution and demographic analysis

### **Baseline Results**
- `4class_training_results/` - Original 4-class results (72.4% baseline)
- `doctor_improvement_summary.md` - Strategic analysis of doctor class improvement

## üéØ **KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS**
- **Overall Validation Accuracy:** 75.9% (+3.5% improvement over baseline)
- **Doctor Class Accuracy:** 50.0% (+10 percentage points from 40.0%)
- **Cross-Demographic Generalization:** Proven between 65+ female Caucasian ‚Üí 18-39 male
- **Architecture:** 2.98M parameters, validated scalability from binary ‚Üí 4-class

## üîß **CRITICAL RECOVERY PARAMETERS**
- **Enhanced Class Weights:** Doctor class = 2.265x weight with 2x boost
- **Doctor-Specific Augmentation:** 5x multiplier, ¬±20% brightness, temporal speed variations
- **Fine-Tuning Approach:** Lower learning rate (0.002), gentler optimization
- **Checkpoint System:** Complete state preservation with automatic resume capability

## üìã **RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Load model: `torch.load('doctor_focused_results/best_doctor_focused_model.pth', weights_only=False)`
2. Use training script: `python doctor_focused_trainer.py` with identical configuration
3. Dataset splits: Use `classifier training 20.9.25/` for exact demographic separation
4. Hyperparameters: All proven settings preserved in `doctor_focused_trainer.py`

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** This backup represents the highest cross-demographic validation accuracy achieved (75.9%). Use this as fallback if 7-class training performs below this threshold.
